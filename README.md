## üìù Description
Welcome to my project! Here, I‚Äôll provide you with a brief overview of what inspired me to create it, why it solves a problem, and what I‚Äôve learned throughout its development.
- Motivation: Many large companies already use 3D graphics to showcase products. I developed this project with the motivation to create my own ThreeJS 3D product website and provide it with maximum customer experience with the power of artificial intelligence!
- Why I Built This Project: My main goal was to create a practical and user-friendly solution to a real-world problem of fashion customers.
- Problem Solved: This project aims to simplify customer design own t-shirt with AI support and making it more efficient and accessible.
- What I Learned: Throughout the development process, I gained valuable insights into various technologies such as ThreeJS, React Three Fiber, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion and thier programming concepts.
